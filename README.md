# KEERA Calculator Application


Project Overview: In my 4th semester of Degree, my colleagues and I developed the KEERA Calculator Application, 
a user-friendly and interactive tool designed to help primary school students practice basic math operations based on the KSSR Matematik syllabus for Standards 1, 2, and 3.
The application features three levels of difficulty, each aligned with a specific year of the Malaysian curriculum, allowing users to seamlessly switch between them.

Technologies used : Java, Java Swing, NetBeans, GitHub

Key Features:

Level-Based Functionality: The calculator operates across three levels, each with its own rules and constraints that align with the learning objectives for Standards 1, 2, and 3 in the KSSR Matematik syllabus. 
Users can easily switch between levels with a simple button on the interface.

Interactive Input: Users can enter mathematical expressions by clicking on buttons, and the application processes the input in real time to display results.

Input Validation: The application ensures that both the input and output are valid within the scope of the selected level. If an expression exceeds the levelâ€™s constraints, a popup message will notify the user to correct it.

Graphical User Interface: Utilized Java Swing to create a visually appealing and intuitive interface, enhancing user interaction and engagement.

Version Control: Employed GitHub for source code version control, facilitating effective collaboration, version tracking, and project management throughout the development process.

This project strengthened my skills in developing educational applications with interactive interfaces and integrating curriculum-specific logic. 
It also enhanced my Java programming and desktop application development using NetBeans and Java Swing, while improving my understanding of version control with GitHub.
